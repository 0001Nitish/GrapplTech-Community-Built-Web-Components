      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Nitish Mittal, a recent B.Tech graduate with a robust foundation in
        backend development, particularly with Java and Spring Boot. My academic
        journey has been enriched with diverse experiences and practical
        knowledge, culminating in a degree that has prepared me for the dynamic
        and ever-evolving field of software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my B.Tech program, I actively sought opportunities to apply my
        learning in real-world settings, leading me to undertake internships in
        Java development, cloud computing, and data analytics. These experiences
        have collectively shaped my understanding of technology and its
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I aim to become a software engineer who excels in
        technical skills and understands the broader business context. I am
        actively seeking unique project opportunities that challenge me
        creatively and apply my knowledge in innovative ways.
